# Frequency bands

This demonstrates how one could implement a simple neurofeedback application.

Run the app:

```
$ timeflux main.yaml
```

Open a browser, and visualize:

- [The raw EEG data](http://localhost:8000/monitor/)
- [The relative and absolute frequency bands for the `Fpz` channel](http://localhost:8000/bands/)
