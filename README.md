# Demos

This repository contains end-to-end Timeflux demos.  

Currently, you can find:
- a [P300 speller](../../tree/main/speller/P300/) based on Riemannian geometry
- a [hyperscanning](../../tree/main/hyperscanning/) demos using Jinja and environment variables for
customization
- a simple neurofeedback application based on [frequency bands](../../tree/main/neurofeedback/bands/)

More demos will be added soon.
Have fun!
